# Week 9 project for CISC208

   I was able to download all of the development environment content from this weeks assignment.
During the node.js, I received quite a few errors, including one that said "profile file does not exist".
I am working on getting my laptop ownership set to me (long story), but havn't got to do so yet.
Errors relating to Python also appeared saying that it was not able to connect to the remote server
to install Python.
   yarn, react (as global), and create-react-app all installed fine and are able to run. I played around
with my expense tracker app and settled on Notepad++ as my code editor, for now.
I was able to load all of the required dependencies and launch my expense tracker with minimal
effort.
   I installed expo and created accounts for Github, expo, and installed the phone app for expo. 
The phone app updates very quickly, and syncs in real time to the running App.js file, displaying
the running App.js program. All I have to do to see the changes is save the App.js file.

***** I need you to look at my react-native setup (not expo, which works fine) because,
while following the instructions to setup an android emulator, I accidently installed the
'other' option (the one that takes a long time).
